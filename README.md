# Hi, I'm Matt (fizix-boi, on here, that is)

- I'm currently a graduate student in physics studying quantum engineering
- I use this github for personal suites and simulations, school-related projects, collaborative research coding resources
- Contact me via email (fizixboi@gmail.com) for questions, comments, concerns, or whatever have you ðŸ˜‹

For now, until next time, with all due computation!
